## 1. Email correspondence

### 1.1. Communicating with users

PEGA can send automated email correspondence to all relevant parties.

### 1.2. Identify users with whom to communicate

- You can send correspondence to a specific email address.
- This option depends on a consistent email address.
- To avoid recurring changes to an email address, you can use fields, participants, and user references to send email correspondence.

**Fields**

You can send an email based on the value of a field.

**Participants**

You can also use participant information to send correspondence to a group of stakeholders.

PEGA's default participants for correspondence:

| Participant | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Owner       | The person who created the case                                          |
| Customer    | The person on whose behalf the case is transacted                        |
| Interested  | A person who tracks the progress of a case but does not process the case |

> You can also send email correspondence to all participants.

**User references**

In cases where the correspondence needs to be sent to one specific user in your application, you can use a user reference. 

### 1.3. Identify how to compose the correspondence

- PEGA provides a rich text editor to create formatted email correspondence.
- The editor allows you to reuse data from the case in the email. 
- You can also use existing correspondence templates.

### 1.4. Identify when to communicate with users

**Send email automation**

- Pega Platform simplifies sending correspondence by allowing you to add a Send email automation to your case to send an email.
- When a case reaches the Send email step, the email is automatically sent to the selected parties.

**Case level notifications**

- allows you to automatically send a notification when an assignment in the case is routed to a user worklist. 
- are automatically configured to send to the user associated with the worklist.

> If the message is left blank, the default message is used: `.pyLabel + "(" + .pyID + ") moved to your worklist"`

> Notifications are only sent once the case enters the routed assignments.
