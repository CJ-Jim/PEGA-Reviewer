## 1. Passed deadline interval

The **passed deadline interval** defines when to take further action because the step or case is past the deadline.

- The interval measures the time that has passed since the deadline for a still-open assignment.
- The passed deadline interval is configurable in **Dev Studio** only.
- Unlike the goal and deadline intervals, you can configure the passed deadline interval to repeat a fixed number of times or until the user completes the assignment.
- You can continue to increase the assignment urgency and send an escalation action each time the passed deadline elapses.

### 1.1. Urgency with the passed deadline interval

The maximum urgency is 100. At an urgency value of 100, PEGA ignores further urgency adjustments and continues other escalation actions.

> For example, if the deadline passes, PEGA notifies the assigned user. If the assignment urgency is 100 at deadline, Pega Platform ignores the urgency increment and still sends the notification.
