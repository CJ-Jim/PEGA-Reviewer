## 1. Mobile app channels

You can use the existing mobile channel to quickly build a consumer-grade app, or modify an app to meet your needs.

- A mobile channel provides developers a way to intuitively configure and customize various aspects of mobile app behavior. 
- The mobile channel is organized into settings logically grouped on the **Content**, **Configuration**, **Layout**, and **Manage** tabs. 
- The channel provides a real-time preview of the app design, tailored to the current tab.

### 1.1. Mobile app security

To make your mobile app more secure, you can use the **Security** tab to select an authentication model and configure the locking settings for your app.

- You can also disable authentication requirements for users who want to access the app by selecting a role that determines which users have access to the mobile channel.

### 1.2. Mobile app branding

You can tailor the app's interfaces to reflect your brand identity. For a professional look and feel and to ensure a consistent user experience across the channels, you can customize the interface to match the branding requirements.

#### 1.2.1. Icon and launch screen design

To ensure that users can easily recognize and find your mobile app, use the Mobile app preview to create a personalized app launch screen and icon, specifying corresponding icons and background colors.

- You can customize the app branding by:
    - uploading an image
    - selecting from a list of font icons
    - or using the default text-based icons

#### 1.2.2. Theme customization

To ensure a consistent experience throughout the user workflow, define an application-wide theme for your app.

- In the **Layout** tab, specify colors for various interface elements and observe the changes in real-time on the mobile app preview.
