## 1. Automation shapes

Certain steps, such as collecting identifying information from a customer, require user action, while other steps can be performed automatically by the system, such as sending a confirmation email to a customer.

Automations provide flexibility because each automation has unique parameters that you can configure based on your business requirements. Additionally, utilizing automations reduces possible human error by reducing the amount of human interaction.
