## 1. Optional actions

You can define actions that users optionally perform during case processing. These actions are called **optional actions**.

Optional actions may also be common case processing actions that may be invoked at varying times during the case. For example, PEGA provides an optional **Change Stage** action that may be called at any time during case processing.

Depending on the business need, the optional action can be:

- a process if a series of steps are required
- or a user action if exactly one step is required.

Optional actions are accessible at runtime from the **Actions** menu in the case.

## 2. Case-wide and stage-only actions

You can add optional actions as **case-wide** or **stage-only** actions. If your action or process is only relevant in the context of a specific stage, configure the work as a stage-only action. PEGA provides some built-in case wide actions like **Change Stage** and **Transfer Assignment**.
