## 1. The Explore Data landing page

The Explore Data landing page allows you to explore and analyze data in your application quickly

On the Explore Data landing page, you can:

- query your data
- sort
- filter
- group the results
- access the list of assignments that are routed to members of your team
- drill down and analyze the assignment statuses to determine the remaining workload for the current release
- save queries as **insights**.

### 1.1. Insights

- Insights are rules that PEGA uses to transform data queries into tables or visualizations that you can then share between users
- You can use insights to retrieve specific data and present the data as a list or an interactive chart

### 1.2. Layout of the Explore Data landing page

The Explore Data Landing page displays a list of previously-created insights.
