## 1. Decision tables

A decision table consists of a table of conditions and results.

- You define a set of conditions and the results to return when the conditions are true.
- Each set of conditions contains a corresponding result.
- You can add columns for each condition you want to test against and rows for each combination of conditions you want to test.
- When the system evaluates a decision table, it starts with the top row and evaluates each condition in the row. 
    - If all of the conditions are true, the system returns the result for that row. 
    - If not, it advances to the next row, and evaluates the conditions in that row. 
    - And if none of the combinations returns a result, the system returns the otherwise result at the bottom of the table. This ensures that the decision always returns a result.

### 1.1. Decision table logic

Decision tables are a good approach when you use a set of properties or expressions to arrive at a decision.

- By default, a condition uses an equal comparison operator.
- If you are using numeric conditions, you can also specify greater than or less than comparison operators.

### 1.2. Decision tables in App Studio

You can configure calculated fields using out-of-the-box basic functions and simple custom expressions in App Studio. 

- For complex calculations which involve multiple conditions with varying results based on the conditions, you can configure a calculated field that references an existing or custom decision table.
