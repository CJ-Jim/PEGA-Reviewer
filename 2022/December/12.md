## Notes:

### Data modeling

- Data model defines the types and structures of data in your application and standardizes how data elements relate to one another
- It is crucial that the data that comes into your application is in a format that makes sense for your business

#### Model data components

* Fields
    - Properties that store and format data in your application
* Data objects
    - Categories of data that have fields, field mappings, and connections to data sources

#### Data storage

- Work- class
    * includes all classes that define work items in your application

#### Best practices

- A developer should verify the data model with a Lead System Architect before creating data objects or properties
- create the data model by using the Data Explorer first, keeping reuse and inheritance in mind
- use the configure view screen when only a small number of fields are needed
