# Notes

## Introducing Scrum

#### Principles of the Agile Manifesto:
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

#### Done
- a shared understanding of completeness and release quality.

#### Sprint Goal
- provide an objective to be met during a sprint.

#### Roles:
* Product Owner
* Development Team
* Scrum Master

#### Events (Sprint - duration of 1 month or less):
1. Sprint Planning
    - Sprint goal, Sprint backlog
    - 8 hours or less
    - what work can be done in this sprint?
    - how will the chosen work get done?
2. Daily Scrum
    - Updated daily plan
    - 15 minutes
3. Sprint Review
    - Updated product backlog
    - 4 hours or less
    - scrum team and stakeholders inspects the increment and collaborate about what was done in the sprint.
4. Sprint Retrospective
    - Improvements for next sprint
    - 3 hours or less
    - scrum team inspects itself

#### Artifacts:
* Product Backlog
    - holds all the requiremens of the products
    - managed by the product owner
    - can be done in 1 day
* Sprint Backlog
    - holds all the work for the sprint goal
    - managed by the development team
* Increment
    - working addition to the product
    - always potentially releasable

Upon the creation of a scrum team:
- establishment of a product vision
- creating a defnition of done
- and making a working agreement

#### Scrum Framework

#### Empricism
- Knowledge comes from experience
- makes decisions based on what is known
- requires **Trust**

#### Three pillars of Empricism:
* Transparency
    - Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
    - these aspects must be defined by a common standard
    - We all know what's going on
* Inspection
    - must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.
    - should not be so frequent that it gets in the way of the work.
    - Check your work as you do it
* Adaptation
    - if one or more aspects of a process deviates outside acceptable limits and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
    - Change tactical direction

#### Complexity
Using the Stacey Matrix, Scrum thrives in the complex zone.
